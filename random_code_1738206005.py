```python
# Undersea Adventure: Explore the depths of the ocean!
def undersea_adventure():
    print("Welcome to your undersea adventure!")
    depth = 0

    while depth < 5:  # Dive deeper into the ocean
        depth += 1
        print(f"Diving deeper... Current depth: {depth} meters")

    print("You've reached the ocean floor!")
    treasure = "glimmering seashell"

    def inspect_treasure():
        print(f"You found a {treasure}!")
    
    inspect_treasure()

undersea_adventure()
