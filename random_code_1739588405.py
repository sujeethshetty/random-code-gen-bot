In this program, the user embarks on an interdimensional quest to search for a book in a mystical library. The function `find_book` searches the library catalog for the specified book title, and a loop iterates through the catalog to find a match. The user can input the title of the book they are looking for, and the program informs them whether the book is found in the interdimensional library or not.
