Here is a simple Python program that generates a random quote each time it is run:

```python
import random

# List of quotes
quotes = [
    "The only way to do great work is to love what you do. - Steve Jobs",
    "In the end, it's not the years in your life that count. It's the life in your years. - Abraham Lincoln",
    "The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall. - Nelson Mandela",
    "Believe you can and you're halfway there. - Theodore Roosevelt",
    "The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams. - Eleanor Roosevelt"
]
