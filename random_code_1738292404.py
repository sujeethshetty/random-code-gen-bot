```python
# Undersea Adventure: Treasure Hunt

def explore_undersea():
    print("Diving into the deep sea for a treasure hunt!")
    treasures = ["shiny pearl", "golden trident", "ancient chest"]
    for treasure in treasures:
        print("Found a", treasure)
    print("Surface with the treasures and enjoy the spoils!")

explore_undersea()
```

This program simulates an undersea adventure where a diver explores the deep sea and discovers treasures such as a shiny pearl, golden trident, and ancient chest. The `explore_undersea` function initiates the adventure and utilizes a loop to iterate through the treasures found.
