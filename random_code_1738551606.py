```python
# Welcome to the Enchanted Workshop where magical gadgets are crafted!
# This program simulates the creation process of a mystical potion.

def mix_ingredients(ingredients):
    mixed_potion = ""
    for ingredient in ingredients:
        mixed_potion += ingredient + " "
    return mixed_potion

def brew_potion(ingredient_list):
    potion = mix_ingredients(ingredient_list)
    return potion.capitalize()

ingredients_list = ["unicorn tears", "dragon scales", "phoenix feathers", "fairy dust"]
enchanted_potion = brew_potion(ingredients_list)

print("In the Enchanted Workshop, a special potion is being brewed...")
print("The magical potion created is:", enchanted_potion)
```

This whimsical Python program represents an enchanted workshop where a mystical potion is being crafted. The `mix_ingredients` function combines a list of ingredients into a potion, while the `brew_potion` function capitalizes the potion's name. The main script generates and displays the final enchanted potion created in the workshop.
