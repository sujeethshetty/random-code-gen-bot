```python
# Welcome to the Mythical Creatures Exhibit!
# Behold the mystical creatures on display!

def exhibit_creatures(creatures):
    for creature in creatures:
        print(f"Welcome to the exhibit! Behold the {creature}.")

# List of mythical creatures in the exhibit
mythical_creatures = ["Phoenix", "Dragon", "Centaur", "Kraken", "Griffin"]

# Display the mythical creatures in the exhibit
exhibit_creatures(mythical_creatures)
```

In this program, we have a function `exhibit_creatures` that takes a list of mythical creatures as input and displays each creature's name. The exhibit features creatures such as Phoenix, Dragon, Centaur, Kraken, and Griffin. The `for` loop iterates over each creature in the list and prints a welcome message for each one. This program demonstrates the use of functions, loops, and lists in Python to create an entertaining mythical creatures exhibit experience.
