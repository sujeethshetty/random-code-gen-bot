Certainly! Here's a magical Python program that simulates an enchanted workshop where items are crafted using mystical ingredients:

```python
def enchant_item(item_name, ingredients):
    enchanted_item = ""
    for ingredient in ingredients:
        enchanted_item += chr(ord(ingredient) + len(ingredient))
    return f"Enchanted {item_name}: {enchanted_item}"

def main():
    print("Welcome to the Enchanted Workshop!\n")
    
    items_to_enchant = {
        "Wand": ["unicorn hair", "phoenix feather", "dragon scale"],
        "Potion": ["moonlight dew", "star essence", "fairy dust"],
        "Ring": ["elfin silver", "mermaid pearl", "goblin gold"]
    }
    
    for item, ingredients in items_to_enchant.items():
        enchanted_result = enchant_item(item, ingredients)
        print(enchanted_result)
    
    print("\nCrafting complete. Visit us again for more enchantments!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this enchanted workshop, different items like wands, potions, and rings are enchanted using unique ingredients. The `enchant_item` function transforms the ingredients into an enchanted version of the item by shifting the characters based on the length of the ingredient. The program showcases the magical crafting process in a whimsical way using loops and functions.
